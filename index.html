            <p>My name is Lucas Carvalho. I am a Software Development student. For almost 10 years I worked as a physics 
                and mathematics teacher, which helped me develop an excellent ability to solve problems and think in a 
                practical and logical way. During this time, I developed skills capable of producing documentation, 
                analytical thinking and the ability to work with others. I recently worked as an intern at KIS Solutions, 
                a company based in Bellingham, WA, which helped me put into practice everything I had already learned. 
                I also learned and improved skills such as Typescript, SQL, Java, HTML and CSS. I further improved my 
                English in a very practical way and learned a lot about the culture in the IT area.
